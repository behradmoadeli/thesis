	This thesis is an original work conducted by Behrad `Brad' Moadeli under the supervision of Prof. Stevan Dubljevic and is funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada. It is submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Chemical Engineering at the University of Alberta.

	\textbf{The thesis follows a paper-based format:} Each chapter corresponds to a peer-reviewed manuscript that has been published, submitted, or is currently under review. While the individual chapters are self-contained, they collectively contribute to a unified framework for the estimation and control of chemically realistic distributed parameter systems with state delay.
