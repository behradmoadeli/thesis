Figure~\ref{fig:reactor_scheme} illustrates the chemical process within an axial dispersion tubular reactor equipped with a recycle stream, where a general nonlinear reaction occurs \cite{levenspiel1998chemical}. A fraction of the outlet stream is recycled and mixed with the fresh input to enhance substrate conversion. By applying mass balance over an infinitesimal element along the reactor axis and linearizing the reaction term around a steady state, the system dynamics can be expressed as a second-order parabolic PDE with a delayed boundary condition. Dankwerts-type boundary conditions are used to account for non-ideal mixing and flow behavior \cite{danckwerts1993continuous}, while the recycle stream introduces a state delay at the reactor inlet. The full modeling rationale—including boundary condition selection, linearization procedure, and physical assumptions—follows our prior work \cite{moadeli2025optimal}, to which the reader is referred for further detail. The resulting PDE system is as follows:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:PDE_original_model}
    \begin{aligned}
        &\dot{c}(\zeta, t) = D \, \partial^2_{\zeta} c(\zeta, t) - v \, \partial_{\zeta} c(\zeta, t) - k_r \, c(\zeta, t) \\
        &\begin{cases}
            D \, \partial_{\zeta} c(0, t) - v \, c(0, t) = -v \left[ R \, c(1, t - \tau) + (1 - R) \, u(t) \right] \\
            \partial_{\zeta} c(1, t) = 0 \\
            y(t) = c(1, t)
        \end{cases}
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Here, $c(\zeta, t)$ denotes the deviation of concentration from the steady state along the reactor length. The parameters $D$, $v$, $k_r$, $R$, and $\tau$ represent the diffusion coefficient, flow velocity, linearized reaction coefficient, recycle ratio, and residence time of the recycle stream, respectively. The spatial and temporal domains are $\zeta \in [0, 1]$ and $t \in [0, \infty)$.

An interesting approach to address delays where the problem involves other forms of PDEs is to reformulate the problem such that the notion of delay is replaced with an alternative transport PDE \cite{krstic2009book}. 
Therefore, the state variable $c(\zeta,t)$ is replaced with a new state variable $\underline{x}(\zeta, t) \equiv [x_1(\zeta, t), x_2(\zeta, t)]^T$ as a vector of functions, where $x_1(\zeta, t)$ represents the concentration within the reactor—analogous to $c(\zeta,t)$—and $x_2(\zeta, t)$ is the new state variable for the concentration along the recycle stream. The system output will consequently be defined as $y(t) = x_1(1, t)$. In addition, the delay can be modeled as a pure transport process rather than being present in the argument of the state at the boundary—i.e. $c(1,t-\tau)$— making all state variables expressed explicitly at a specific time instance $t$, resulting in the standard state-space form for an infinite-dimensional linear time-invariant (LTI) system given in \eqref{eq:state_space}.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:state_space}
    \begin{aligned}
        \dot{\underline{x}}(\zeta, t) &= \mathfrak{A} \underline{x}(\zeta, t) + \mathfrak{B} u(t) \\
        y(t) &= \mathfrak{C} \underline{x}(\zeta, t) + \mathfrak{D} u(t) \\
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Here, $\mathfrak{A}$ is a linear operator $\mathcal{L}(X)$ acting on a Hilbert space $X: L^2[0,1] \times L^2[0,1]$ and $\underline{x}(\zeta,t)$, as defined previously, is the vector of functions describing the states of the system. Input operator $\mathfrak{B}$ is a linear operator that maps the scalar input from input-space onto the state space. Output operator $\mathfrak{C}$ on the other hand, is a linear operator that maps the infinite-dimensional state space onto the finite-dimensional output space, resulting in a scalar output. The operator $\mathfrak{D}$ is the direct transmission operator, which is set to zero in this case as there is no direct transmission from the input to the output in the continuous-time system. The operators ($\mathfrak{A}$, $\mathfrak{B}$, $\mathfrak{C}$, and $\mathfrak{D}$) are shown in \eqref{eq:operator_A} for the infinite-dimensional LTI system.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:operator_A}
    \begin{aligned}
        \mathfrak{A} &\equiv
        \begin{bmatrix}
            D \partial_{\zeta \zeta} - v \partial_\zeta + k_r & 0 \\
            0 & \frac{1}{\tau} \partial_\zeta
        \end{bmatrix} \\
        D(\mathfrak{A}) =& \Bigl\{ \underline{x}(\zeta) = [x_1(\zeta), x_2(\zeta)]^T \in X:\\
        &\underline{x}(\zeta), \partial_\zeta \underline{x}(\zeta), \partial_{\zeta \zeta} \underline{x}(\zeta) \quad \mathrm{a.c.},\\
        &D \partial_\zeta x_1(0) - v x_1(0) = -v R x_2(0),\\
        &\partial_\zeta x_1(1) = 0,
        x_1(1) = x_2(1) \Bigr\}\\
        \mathfrak{B} &\equiv
        \begin{bmatrix}
            \delta(\zeta) \\
            0
        \end{bmatrix} v(1-R) \\
        \mathfrak{C} &\equiv
        \begin{bmatrix}
            \int_0^1 \delta(\zeta-1) (\cdot) d\zeta & 0
        \end{bmatrix} \\
        \mathfrak{D} &= 0
        % \mathcal{D}(\mathfrak{C}) &= \mathcal{D}(\mathfrak{A})
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
with $\delta(\zeta)$ being dirac delta function. The system's spectrum can now be obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem for the system generator $\mathfrak{A}$. To do this, the characteristics equation of the system needs to be obtained by solving the equation $det(\mathfrak{A}-\lambda_i~I)~=~0$ for $\lambda_i$, where $\lambda_i \in \mathbb{C}$ is the $i^{\text{th}}$ eigenvalue of the system and $I$ is the identity operator. Attempts to analytically solve this equation will fail; therefore, it is solved numerically given the parameters in Table~\ref{tab:pars}. The eigenvalue distribution is given in Figure~\ref{fig:eigval_dist} in the complex plane. This suggests that the open-loop system is unstable, as there are eigenvalues with positive real parts.

The exact closed-form representation for the resolvent operator is derived in Appendix \ref{app:resolvent}. Since the system is not self-adjoint, the adjoint system operators $\mathfrak{A}^*$ and $\mathfrak{B}^*$ as well as the resolvent operator for the adjoint system must be obtained in the same manner as the original system. However, this is not included in the manuscript to avoid redundancy.
